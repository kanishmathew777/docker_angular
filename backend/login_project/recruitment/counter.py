"""
A flight arrived at an airport at 4:20 AM, and the passengers reach the immigration queue, where the counters open at 4:30 AM. There are 3 counters where the passengers can finish their process. First counter takes 5 mins to complete, 2nd takes 7 mins and the third 10 mins. Counters are filled from leftmost counter first, if thatâ€™s free and so on towards the last one.
Write a program to calculate the time at which Nth passenger finish their process and leave the counter. Print the time and the counter that they have done their process

Eg: Input 10
Output: Passenger at position 10 in queue leave from counter 1 at 4:55 PM
Input 74
Output: Passenger at position 74 in queue leave from counter 2 at 7:18 PM
